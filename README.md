# Vinyl

The purpose of this app is for me to catalog the large vinyl collection I own.

This app uses Flask framework for Python and Vite for Javascript.

Be sure to install do the following when installing
npm install Vite
pip install Flask
pop install -U flask-cors

Then to get started in a terminal with flask-server as the main folder do:
venv\scripts\activate
python server.py

In another temrminal with vite-project open:
npm run dev
